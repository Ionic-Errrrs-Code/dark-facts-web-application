## 📖 About The Project

This web application is built around a simple idea: **reading is an experience, not a race**.

It brings together short facts, subtle humor, and psychological insights in a calm, distraction-free environment designed for comfort and focus. Every screen is intentionally minimal, every interaction paced, and every transition quiet—so the content has room to breathe.

Rather than overwhelming users with noise or endless scrolling, the app emphasizes timing, spacing, and clarity. Jokes land better when they're not rushed. Facts stick when they're given space. Thought feels deeper when attention is respected.

The interface is dark, deliberate, and reading-first. Animations are subtle and meaningful. Nothing flashes, jumps, or demands attention. The goal is simple: **make reading feel natural, enjoyable, and intentional**.

This project explores how design psychology, motion restraint, and typography can shape a better reading experience—one moment at a time.
